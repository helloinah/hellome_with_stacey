<p>Poster, More Than A Gaze is <br /> a visual research project examining the interaction the audience has with the public posters.</p> The research included an observation of the posters <br /> on public space as well as testing some interactive poster. </p>
<p>The final response of this project was an poster for an exhibition, explained to show &lsquo;contemporary&rsquo; poster design but in fact directing the audience to the spots where the most of the public poster appears. I wanted to shift the general perception on street posters, as I found the lack of ownership by the public during my research. </p>
