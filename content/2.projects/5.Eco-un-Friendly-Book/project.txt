content: 
<p>&lsquo;Eco-(un)-Friendly book&rsquo; requires each page to be torn off one ata time along perforated lines to be read. It tells the story of paperproduction in an educative yet satirical tone, inspired by theillustrative style of Tae-hyung Kim; old children&rsquo;s textbook illustration, characterised by utopian depiction of the everyday life.</p>
<p>This irony of the book (the book hopes to be an eco-friendly source,whereby it is disposable) hopes to reflect the context of our waste andprompt audience to reflect on their &lsquo;acts&rsquo; toward the environment byillustration literally the irreversible nature of our environment.
