<p>The project Another: Being on the Other Side of the River is designed to engage the general public about the violations of human rights committed against North Koreans. </p>
<p>Through the use of a script divided into two books and a supplementary visual reference book, the project aims to create an embodied experience of &lsquo;being&rsquo; North Korean to enhance empathy and understanding. The script itself is a collection of first hand experiences of North Korean escapees.</p>
