content: 
<p>&lsquo;Bangkok Elvis&rsquo; is a heavy display font featuring the characteristics of Thai script and culture.</p>
<p>At the time, as both Roman and Thai scripts were foreign to me, I studied them as images first then combined the forms. This resulted in the font encompassing both characteristics of serif & san-serif, Roman & Asian, contemporary & traditional.</p>
