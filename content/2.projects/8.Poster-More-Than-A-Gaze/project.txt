Poster, More Than A Gaze is a visual research project examining the interaction the audience has with the public posters.<br /><br /> The research included an observation of the posters on public space as well as experimenting possible interactivity using three posters that I made up. <br /><br />
The final outcome of this research project was a poster booklet on fake exhibition, directing the audience into the public spaces where most of the posters on streets appear and asking them to criticise them.
