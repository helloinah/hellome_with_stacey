content: <p>Working with the art director and designers at Deuce design, I developed custom pictograms and map graphic for the Sydney ports signage program. </p><p>The program outlined the site&rsquo;s history, facilities but also preserved natural fauna and surrounding ecological system, which is unique to the site. The customised pictogram and wayfinding graphic highlights this uniqueness of the site.</p>
